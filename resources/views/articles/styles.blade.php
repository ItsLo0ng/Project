            <p>
                Calligraphy styles reflect the history, tools, and philosophy of the cultures
                that created them. Each style has its own rhythm, structure, and emotional tone.

            <h2>Western Calligraphy Styles</h2>

            <h3>Roman Capitals</h3>
            <p>
                Roman capitals are the foundation of Western letterforms.
                Carved into stone monuments, they emphasize balance, proportion, and clarity.
            </p>

            <h3>Gothic (Blackletter)</h3>
            <p>
                Gothic calligraphy is dense and dramatic, widely used in medieval manuscripts.
                Its strong vertical strokes give it a powerful and formal presence.
            </p>

            <h3>Italic Script</h3>
            <p>
                Developed during the Renaissance, italic script is elegant, fluid,
                and ideal for fast yet expressive writing.
            </p>

            <h2>Eastern Calligraphy Styles</h2>

            <h3>Chinese Brush Calligraphy</h3>
            <p>
                Chinese calligraphy is deeply connected to philosophy and meditation.
                Every stroke reflects the artist’s control, energy, and emotional state.
            </p>

            <h3>Japanese Shodō</h3>
            <p>
                Shodō emphasizes simplicity and movement. Negative space plays a vital role,
                allowing each character to breathe.
            </p>

            <h2>Modern Calligraphy</h2>
            <p>
                Modern calligraphy breaks traditional rules, combining classic forms
                with contemporary creativity. It is widely used in branding, social media,
                and digital font design.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                “Styles may differ, but every calligraphy form begins with intention and movement.”
            </blockquote>
