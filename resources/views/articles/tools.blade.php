            <p>
                Calligraphy tools influence line quality, rhythm, and expression.
                Choosing the right materials is as important as mastering technique.
            </p>

            <h2>Traditional Tools</h2>

            <h3>Dip Pens & Nibs</h3>
            <p>
                Dip pens with interchangeable nibs allow for sharp contrasts
                between thick and thin strokes. They are commonly used in Western calligraphy.
            </p>

            <h3>Brushes</h3>
            <p>
                Brushes are essential for East Asian calligraphy.
                They respond to pressure and speed, creating expressive and dynamic strokes.
            </p>

            <h3>Ink</h3>
            <p>
                Ink consistency affects flow and texture.
                Traditional inks are often water-based, while modern inks provide more durability.
            </p>

            <h3>Paper</h3>
            <p>
                Smooth paper prevents ink bleeding, while textured paper adds character.
                Handmade papers are often favored for artistic pieces.
            </p>

            <h2>Modern & Digital Tools</h2>

            <h3>Brush Pens</h3>
            <p>
                Brush pens combine the flexibility of brushes with the convenience of pens,
                making them ideal for beginners and modern calligraphy.
            </p>

            <h3>Tablets & Stylus</h3>
            <p>
                Digital calligraphy allows artists to experiment endlessly.
                Tools like iPads and styluses are widely used for font creation and design.
            </p>
